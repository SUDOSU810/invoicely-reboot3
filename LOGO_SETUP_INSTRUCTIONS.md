# Logo Setup Instructions

## 📋 **To Use Your Exact Logo**

### **Step 1: Save Your Logo Image**
1. Save the logo image you provided as `invoicely-logo.png`
2. Place it in the `public/` directory of your project
3. The file path should be: `public/invoicely-logo.png`

### **Step 2: Verify Implementation**
The code is already updated to use your exact logo image:

#### **Navigation Component** (`components/ui/navigation.tsx`)
- ✅ Uses `<InvoicelyLogo width={120} height={40} />`
- ✅ Displays in landing page navigation

#### **Layout Component** (`src/components/Layout.tsx`)  
- ✅ Uses `<InvoicelyLogo width={100} height={32} />`
- ✅ Displays in top-left corner of Home/History/Settings pages

#### **Logo Component** (`components/ui/invoicely-logo.tsx`)
- ✅ Simple wrapper that displays your PNG image
- ✅ Responsive and customizable sizing

### **Step 3: File Structure**
```
your-project/
├── public/
│   └── invoicely-logo.png  ← Your exact logo goes here
├── components/
│   └── ui/
│       └── invoicely-logo.tsx  ← Already created
└── src/
    └── components/
        └── Layout.tsx  ← Already updated
```

### **Step 4: Logo Placement**
Once you add the image file, your logo will appear:

1. **Landing Page**: Top navigation bar (120x40px)
2. **Home Page**: Top-left corner (100x32px)  
3. **History Page**: Top-left corner (100x32px)
4. **Settings Page**: Top-left corner (100x32px)

## 🎯 **What's Already Done**

- ✅ Logo component created
- ✅ Navigation updated to use your logo
- ✅ Layout updated with top-left logo placement
- ✅ Responsive sizing implemented
- ✅ Glass morphism background for app sections

## 📝 **Next Steps**

1. **Add your logo image** to `public/invoicely-logo.png`
2. **Test the application** - logo should appear in all locations
3. **Adjust sizing if needed** by modifying the `width` and `height` props

That's it! Your exact logo will be used throughout the application.
