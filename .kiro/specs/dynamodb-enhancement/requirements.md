# DynamoDB Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the enhancement of the existing DynamoDB implementation in the invoice generator application to better handle AWS Academy lab limitations, improve offline capabilities, and provide a more robust data persistence solution. The current implementation has a good foundation but needs improvements in connection management, credential handling, and user experience when AWS services are unavailable.

## Glossary

- **Invoice_System**: The React-based invoice generator application
- **DynamoDB_Service**: The AWS DynamoDB integration service for persistent storage
- **LocalStorage_Service**: The browser localStorage fallback service
- **AWS_Academy**: The educational AWS environment with temporary credentials
- **Hybrid_Storage**: The combined approach using both DynamoDB and localStorage
- **Connection_Manager**: The component responsible for managing AWS connectivity
- **Credential_Manager**: The component handling AWS Academy credential updates

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Connection Management

**User Story:** As a user working with AWS Academy labs, I want the application to gracefully handle connection issues and provide clear feedback about storage status, so that I can continue working even when the lab is offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AWS Academy lab is offline, THE Invoice_System SHALL automatically fallback to localStorage without user intervention
2. WHEN DynamoDB connection is restored, THE Invoice_System SHALL automatically sync pending changes from localStorage to DynamoDB
3. WHILE the application is running, THE Connection_Manager SHALL monitor DynamoDB connectivity every 30 seconds
4. THE Invoice_System SHALL display a clear status indicator showing current storage mode (DynamoDB, localStorage, or hybrid)
5. IF DynamoDB connection fails during an operation, THEN THE Invoice_System SHALL complete the operation using localStorage and queue it for later sync

### Requirement 2: Improved Credential Management

**User Story:** As a user with AWS Academy credentials, I want to easily update my credentials when they expire, so that I can continue using DynamoDB without losing data or functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Invoice_System SHALL provide a settings interface for updating AWS Academy credentials
2. WHEN credentials are updated, THE DynamoDB_Service SHALL immediately test the new connection
3. THE Credential_Manager SHALL detect expired credentials and prompt for renewal
4. WHERE credentials are invalid, THE Invoice_System SHALL show specific error messages with guidance
5. THE Invoice_System SHALL securely store credentials in environment variables or secure storage

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Data Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user who works both online and offline, I want my invoice data to be automatically synchronized when connectivity is restored, so that I don't lose any work or have data conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DynamoDB becomes available after being offline, THE Hybrid_Storage SHALL sync all localStorage-only invoices to DynamoDB
2. THE Invoice_System SHALL detect and resolve conflicts when the same invoice exists in both storage systems
3. WHILE syncing data, THE Invoice_System SHALL prioritize DynamoDB data over localStorage for existing invoices
4. THE Invoice_System SHALL maintain a sync queue for operations that failed due to connectivity issues
5. IF sync conflicts occur, THEN THE Invoice_System SHALL log the conflicts and use DynamoDB as the source of truth

### Requirement 4: Enhanced User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visibility into where my data is stored and what happens when storage systems are unavailable, so that I can make informed decisions about my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Invoice_System SHALL display a storage status indicator in the main interface
2. WHEN operating in localStorage-only mode, THE Invoice_System SHALL show a warning about data persistence limitations
3. THE Invoice_System SHALL provide export/backup functionality that works regardless of storage mode
4. WHERE DynamoDB is unavailable, THE Invoice_System SHALL suggest actions the user can take
5. THE Invoice_System SHALL show sync progress when uploading localStorage data to DynamoDB

### Requirement 5: Robust Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle storage errors gracefully and provide helpful guidance, so that I can resolve issues and continue working productively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DynamoDB operations fail, THE Invoice_System SHALL provide specific error messages with suggested solutions
2. THE Invoice_System SHALL distinguish between credential issues, network problems, and service unavailability
3. IF localStorage quota is exceeded, THEN THE Invoice_System SHALL warn the user and suggest data cleanup options
4. THE Invoice_System SHALL log all storage operations for debugging purposes
5. WHERE both storage systems fail, THE Invoice_System SHALL provide emergency data export functionality

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and responsive invoice operations regardless of which storage system is being used, so that my workflow is not interrupted by technical limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Invoice_System SHALL cache frequently accessed data to minimize DynamoDB calls
2. WHEN loading invoices, THE Invoice_System SHALL load localStorage data immediately and enhance with DynamoDB data asynchronously
3. THE Invoice_System SHALL implement connection pooling and retry logic for DynamoDB operations
4. WHERE possible, THE Invoice_System SHALL batch multiple DynamoDB operations together
5. THE Invoice_System SHALL provide loading indicators for operations that may take time

### Requirement 7: Data Integrity and Backup

**User Story:** As a user, I want assurance that my invoice data is safe and recoverable, so that I can trust the application with important business information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Invoice_System SHALL automatically backup localStorage data before attempting DynamoDB sync
2. WHEN data conflicts are detected, THE Invoice_System SHALL preserve both versions for user review
3. THE Invoice_System SHALL provide automated export functionality that runs periodically
4. THE Invoice_System SHALL validate data integrity during sync operations
5. WHERE data corruption is detected, THE Invoice_System SHALL attempt recovery from the alternate storage system

### Requirement 8: Multi-User Support Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user with AWS Cognito authentication, I want my invoices to be properly isolated from other users, so that my data remains private and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE DynamoDB_Service SHALL use Cognito user ID as a partition key for data isolation
2. WHEN no user is authenticated, THE Invoice_System SHALL use anonymous mode with localStorage only
3. THE Invoice_System SHALL migrate anonymous localStorage data to user account upon login
4. WHERE user switches accounts, THE Invoice_System SHALL clear cached data and reload for the new user
5. THE Invoice_System SHALL ensure localStorage data is tagged with user context when possible
