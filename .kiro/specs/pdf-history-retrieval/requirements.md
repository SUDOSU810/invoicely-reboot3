# PDF History Retrieval Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the implementation of a PDF history retrieval system for the invoice generator application. The system will enable users to view and access their previously generated invoice PDFs stored in AWS S3, with metadata stored in DynamoDB. This feature is essential for the history page functionality, allowing users to track, review, and manage their invoice generation history.

## Glossary

- **Invoice_System**: The React-based invoice generator application
- **PDF_History_Service**: The Lambda function service responsible for retrieving PDF metadata and URLs
- **S3_Storage**: AWS S3 bucket containing generated invoice PDF files
- **DynamoDB_Table**: AWS DynamoDB table storing PDF metadata and user associations
- **History_Page**: The application page displaying user's invoice generation history
- **Authenticated_User**: A user logged in through AWS Cognito authentication
- **PDF_Metadata**: Information about stored PDFs including filename, creation date, size, and S3 key

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User-Specific PDF Retrieval

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to view only my previously generated invoice PDFs on the history page, so that I can access my personal invoice history without seeing other users' data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their PDF history, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL retrieve only PDFs associated with the authenticated user's Cognito ID
2. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL use the user's Cognito ID as the primary filter for DynamoDB queries
3. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL return an empty list if no PDFs exist for the user
4. WHERE user authentication fails, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL return an unauthorized error
5. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL validate user identity before processing any retrieval requests

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive PDF Metadata Retrieval

**User Story:** As a user viewing my invoice history, I want to see detailed information about each PDF including creation date, file size, and invoice details, so that I can easily identify and select the invoices I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL retrieve PDF filename, creation timestamp, file size, and S3 object key from DynamoDB
2. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL include invoice-specific metadata such as invoice number, client name, and total amount
3. WHEN PDF metadata is incomplete, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL attempt to retrieve missing information from S3 object metadata
4. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL return metadata in a consistent JSON format for frontend consumption
5. WHERE metadata retrieval fails for individual PDFs, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL exclude those entries from results rather than failing entirely

### Requirement 3: Secure PDF Access URL Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely access my PDF files through temporary URLs, so that I can download or view my invoices without compromising security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL generate pre-signed S3 URLs with limited time validity (15 minutes)
2. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL ensure pre-signed URLs are only generated for PDFs owned by the requesting user
3. WHEN generating pre-signed URLs, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL verify the PDF exists in S3 before creating the URL
4. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL include the pre-signed URL in the response metadata for each PDF
5. WHERE S3 access fails, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL return metadata without the download URL and log the error

### Requirement 4: Efficient Data Pagination and Sorting

**User Story:** As a user with many generated invoices, I want my PDF history to load quickly and be organized chronologically, so that I can efficiently navigate through my invoice history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL support pagination with configurable page size (default 20 items)
2. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL sort PDFs by creation date in descending order (newest first)
3. WHEN pagination is requested, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL return pagination metadata including total count and next page token
4. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL implement efficient DynamoDB query patterns to minimize read capacity consumption
5. WHERE large result sets are requested, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL limit maximum page size to 100 items

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the PDF history feature to work reliably and provide clear feedback when issues occur, so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DynamoDB is unavailable, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL return a service unavailable error with retry guidance
2. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL handle S3 access errors gracefully and return partial results when possible
3. IF authentication tokens are invalid or expired, THEN THE PDF_History_Service SHALL return specific authentication error messages
4. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL log all errors with sufficient detail for debugging while protecting user privacy
5. WHERE timeout occurs during processing, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL return a timeout error with suggested retry interval

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my PDF history to load quickly regardless of how many invoices I have generated, so that I can access my data without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL complete typical requests within 2 seconds for up to 1000 user PDFs
2. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL implement connection pooling for DynamoDB and S3 clients
3. WHEN retrieving multiple PDFs, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL batch S3 operations where possible
4. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL cache frequently accessed metadata for 5 minutes to reduce database load
5. WHERE performance degrades, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL prioritize returning partial results over complete failure

### Requirement 7: Data Consistency and Integrity

**User Story:** As a user, I want confidence that my PDF history accurately reflects all my generated invoices, so that I can rely on the system for business record-keeping.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL verify that referenced S3 objects exist before including them in results
2. WHEN PDF metadata and S3 objects are inconsistent, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL prioritize S3 as the source of truth
3. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL handle cases where DynamoDB entries exist but S3 objects are missing
4. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL validate data integrity during retrieval and flag inconsistencies
5. WHERE data corruption is detected, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL log the issue and exclude corrupted entries from results

### Requirement 8: Integration with Frontend History Page

**User Story:** As a user navigating the history page, I want seamless integration between the frontend interface and the PDF retrieval service, so that I have a smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL return data in a format directly consumable by the React frontend
2. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL support CORS headers for browser-based requests
3. WHEN called from the frontend, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL include appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
4. THE PDF_History_Service SHALL support query parameters for filtering by date range or invoice status
5. WHERE frontend requests include invalid parameters, THE PDF_History_Service SHALL return validation errors with specific guidance
